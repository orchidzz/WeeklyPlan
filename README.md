# WeeklyPlan

## Description
A GUI app for users to block off certain times in a week and add notations to identify what activities are associated with those time blocks.
User can then save the created schedule as an image.

## Future improvements
resizable screen (resizable time blocks), transparent colors, etc.

## Motivation
Applying for part-time jobs often requires sending in a schedule of availability. It is convenient to have a picture of the schedule to send along with multiple applications. 
Why create a new one when there is Goodle Calendar? Well... using Google Calendar for this requires creating a whole new calendar, blocking off times, clicking on every block to change the title, taking screenshot of the finished schedule, etc. So why not reduce a few steps to get the same product? Plus, isn't it an opportunity to learn new framework?

## To run
````
pip install -r requirements.txt
````
Then execute ```` main.py ````
